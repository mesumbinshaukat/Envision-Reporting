## 1. ✅ Net Income Calculation Fixed

### Problem
Net income was incorrectly including unpaid invoices in the calculation.

### Solution
Updated the net income formula to **ONLY include paid invoices**:

**Before:**
```php
'net_income' => $invoices->sum('amount') - $expenses->sum('amount') - $salaryReleases->sum('total_amount')
```

**After:**
```php
'net_income' => $paidInvoices->sum('amount') - $expenses->sum('amount') - $salaryReleases->sum('total_amount')
```

### Formula
```
Net Income = Paid Invoices - Expenses - Salaries
```

**Unpaid invoices are now completely excluded from net income calculations.**

### Table Structure (Before)

**No changes needed** - currency was already correct throughout the application.

## Calculation Verification

### Net Income Formula (100% Accurate)
```
Net Income = Paid Invoices - Expenses - Salaries

Where:
- Paid Invoices = SUM of invoices with status "Payment Done"
- Expenses = SUM of all expenses in date range
- Salaries = SUM of total_amount from salary releases
- Unpaid Invoices = EXCLUDED (not counted)
```

### Example Calculation
```
Paid Invoices:     Rs. 100,000
Unpaid Invoices:   Rs.  30,000  (EXCLUDED)
Expenses:          Rs.  20,000
Salaries:          Rs.  40,000
-----------------------------------
Net Income = 100,000 - 20,000 - 40,000 = Rs. 40,000

Note: The Rs. 30,000 unpaid invoices are NOT included in net income.
```
